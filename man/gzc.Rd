\usage{
gzc(
  emd = NULL,
  ini = NULL,
  m = NULL,
  dt = NULL,
  repl = 1,
  mode = NULL,
  dtout = NULL,
  output = 1,
  warn = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{emd}{emd-type object}

\item{ini}{an optional vector of length n of the eventual initial Intrinsic
Mode Function xy would be a demodulation of, if it is a demodulation. It will
be integrated to the results as mode 1.}

\item{m}{a matrix of the amplitude values (xy) of the components, each
column being a component. Each column should have the same number of non NA
values. Vectors, for 1 component, are accepted. Is overridden by emd.}

\item{dt}{the depth or time value. Is overridden by emd.}

\item{repl}{the amount of replicates in m. Is overridden by emd.}

\item{mode}{the mode sequence index to give to each replicated IMFs}

\item{dtout}{the dt values to sample the frequency and amplitude from if
\code{output = 2}.}

\item{output}{the style of the output, whether 0, 1 or 2. 0 provides the raw
output of \code{\link{gzc.algorithm}}, 1 and 2 provides a matrix with $dt
(depth/time), $f (frequency) and $a ()amplitude, but with \code{output = 1}
the matrix provides the dt only at the extremas and zero-crossings, whereas
with \code{output = 2} the dt values
are the ones provided with the \code{dtout} parameter. 1 is better for
plots, 2 allows easier calculations to be performed downstream.}

\item{warn}{whether to warn if the sampling interval defined by the
\code{dtout} parameter is to small (redirected from
\code{StratigrapheR::tie.lim})}
}
\value{
depending on the output parameter:

\code{output = 0} provides the raw output of \code{\link{gzc.algorithm}},
with $ldt and $rdt (the left and right boundaries of the depth/time
intervals), $f (frequency) and $a (amplitude). To that are added $repl (the
replicate id) and $mode (the mode id)

\code{output = 1} or \code{2} provides a matrix with $dt,
$f and $a, but with \code{output = 1} the matrix provides the dt only at
the extremas and zero-crossings, whereas with \code{output = 2} the dt values
are the ones provided with the \code{out} parameter. \code{1} is better for
plots, \code{2} allows easier calculations to be performed downstream.

Calculates instantaneous frequency using the Generalised
Zero-Crossing method from Huang et al., 2009. General wrapper for the
\code{\link{gzc.algorithm}} function that does all the actual work.
